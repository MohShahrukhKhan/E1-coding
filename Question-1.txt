Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder?

becouse if we want to Extend it it we show us no-change it look as its some ,whre we assign him 

for ex;-
String name="Moh Shahrukh khan"

if we want to extand it 

name.append("is student");

if we print it

they show as no-change
   System.out.println(name)//moh shahrukh khan

that was the reason we canb say that String is immutable.

difference between String and String Builder

both are use to assign the value of String but String is immutable and String Builder mutable we can extand 
his value with help of some Method and they have some limition multi thred Enverment.

methods of String class at least 5 with example.
String name="shahrukh"
name.Substring(2)//sh
name.Substring(index,endIndex)

name.Equals("shahrukh")//if give you boolean value

"Moh shahrukh khan  ".trim()

"Moh shahrukh".replace(index,value)//index=1,value=J-->Mjh Skhahrukh khan

"moh shshrukh khan".toUppercase()//MOH SHAHRUKH KHAN
"MOH SHAHRUKH KHAN"toLowwercase()moh shahrukh khan
